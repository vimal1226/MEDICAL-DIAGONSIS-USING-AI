## Features

- ðŸ©º **Five Disease Predictors**:
  - Diabetes Prediction
  - Heart Disease Risk Assessment
  - Parkinson's Disease Detection (voice analysis)
  - Lung Cancer Risk Evaluation
  - Hypo-Thyroid Diagnosis

- ðŸ’» **Interactive Web Interface**:
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Dynamic input forms
  - Sample data loading
  - Real-time predictions
  - Detailed disease information

- ðŸŽ¨ **Professional UI**:
  - Responsive design
  - Custom styling
  - Background overlay
  - Clear result visualization

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for UI development
- **Backend**: Python and Flask for API integration
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow for model training
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS
